## Downside

- `Live Server++` will work well if your project only contents `css` & `html` and minimal `JavaScript`. If you do lot of DOM Manupulation with JavaScript, `Live Server++` is not recommended.

## How to Start/Stop Server ?

1. Open a project and click to `Go Live++` from the status bar to turn the server on/off.

2. Open the Command Pallete by pressing `F1` or `ctrl+shift+P` and type `Live Server++: Open Server` to start a server or type `Live Server++: Close Server` to stop a server.

## Why `Live Server++` when there is a `Live Server` ?

Actually, I was receiving a lot of emails, PR, comments (and also there was few issue request, e.g. [#12080](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12080)) - `why auto reload only happens when we save the file`? - `why it's not realtime?`... blah blah....

Well, in Live Server Extension, I'm using a popular npm module (named `live-server`) and it's the core library of Live Server. _(yaa! too many "Live Server" üòú)_. In the way it's working - it never possible auto reload without saving the file.

And yaa, to be honest, when I made (in mid of `2017`) the live server extension, I didn't know Node.js or JavaScript well _(Hold on! I still don't know `Node.js` but I'm now confident)_. I even didn't know `promise`/`callback` well. I understood the `callback` _(& `callback hell` too)_ while making the extension. And `Promise`? Only I knew how to use it like `.then().then().then()` and `IIFE`? or `closure`? - I didn't even hear about those names at that time. üò¨

Okay, now coming to the point, Code of the `Live Server` can't be migrated with `Live Server++`. `Live Server++` is not depended on `live-server`(the npm module) - I've written the server side code from scratch & it has minimal dependency (still under development).
